// Aaron Jones - C++ Variables Worksheet

// Intro
// Def'n': C++ is coding language used to build software for things like video games, OS', databases, etc.

// Coding

// Our First C++ Program
#include <iostream> // handles input/output
using namespace std; // namespace is a way to group together related functions, classes, variables, and other symbols. For us, it lets us call cout with having to write std::cout

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!"; // cout is a function in <iostream> to handle output
    return 0;
}

// C++ Comments
// Single-line comments use // (double forward slashes)
// Multi-line comments use /*...*/ (forward slash asterisk and asterisk forward slash)

// Syntax in C++
// C++ uses curly braces -> {} <- to show blocks of code. This is different from Python which uses indentation.
// C++ also needs semicolons -> ; <- to end statements.
// Ex:
if (condition) {
    cout << "Condition is true"; // This line is inside the if-statement.
}
cout << "This line is outside the if-statement";

// C++ Variables
// In C++, variables are declared with a type and a name.
// Ex:
int myVariable; // Declaring a variable that is an integer
myVariable = 10; // Giving a value to that variable

// Usage ex:
int age = 20;
cout << "Age: " << age << endl; // Added 'endl' for better formatting

// C++ Variables are also case-sensitive
int Age = 21;
cout << "age: " << age << ", Age: " << Age << endl; // Added 'endl' for better formatting

// C++ Variable Rules
// Must start with a letter or an underscore character.
// CANNOT start with a number.
// Can only be alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).
// Are case-sensitive.

// Types of naming in C++
// Camel Case: firstName // Each word, except the first, begins with a capital letter
// Pascal Case: FirstName // Each word begins with a capital letter
// Snake Case: first_name or First_Name // Each word is separated by an underscore
