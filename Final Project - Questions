Variables & Data Type Questions:

1. How do we properly declare a Boolean variable and give it a value = to true?

a) example = bool true;

b) example = "true";

c) bool example = "true";

d) bool example = true;

2. What is the ouput of the following code?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float x = 6;
    float y = 3.9;
    int result = x + static_cast<int>(y);
    cout << result;
    return 0;
}

3. What are the different data types in C++?

Input Questions:

1. How do you use the cin object in C++ to receive an input?

2. True or False: You should never declare variables before using cin to take inputs?

3. True or false: cin can only be used to take input for one variable at a time?

Arithmetic operator Questions:

1. What is the output of the code below?

int num1 = 6;
int num2 = 9;
int num3 = 4;
int result = (num1 + num2) * num3;
cout << result;

2. What is the output of the code below?

double num1 = 45.0;
double num2 = 5.0;
double num3 = 2.0;
double result = (num1 - num2) / num3;
cout << result;

3. What is the output of the code below?

int x = 65;
int y = 8;
int result = x % y;
cout << result;

Conditional statement (IF/ELIF/ELSE/Switches) Questions:

1. If the value of x is set to 15, what will print?

if (x >= 14) {
        cout << "x >= 14" << endl;
}

2. If the value of y is 20, what will print?

if (y > 532) {
    cout << "y > 532 << endl;
} else if (y == 532) {
    cout << "y = 532" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "y < 532" << endl;
}

3. If the value of car is 2, what will print?

int car = 2;
switch (car) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Honda" << endl;
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "Hyundai" << endl;
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Toyota" << endl;
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid car" << endl;
}

Nested Conditional Statement Questions:

1. What value would you need to assign x if you wanted the output "10 or below"?

if (x > 10) {
    cout << "X is above 10" << endl;
    if (x > 20) {
        cout << "X is above 20" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "but not above 20" << endl;
    }
} else {
    cout << "10 or below" << endl;
}

2. If the value assigned to score was 80, what would the output be?

if (score > 90) {
    cout << "Wow! You did excellent!" << endl;
    if (score == 100) {
        cout << "You got a perfect score!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You got a near perfect score." << endl;
    }
} else if (score > 75) {
    cout << "Good job." << endl;
} else {
    cout << "You need improvement." << endl;
}

3. What is the  output of the following code?

int age = 17;
int grade = 12;
if (age < 18) {
    cout << "Minor" << endl;
    if (age >= 13 && grade >= 9) {
        cout << "High school student" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Not a high school student" << endl;
    }
} else {
    cout << "Adult" << endl;
}

Compound Boolean Expression Questions: 

1. What will be printed if x = 4, y = 3 and z = 3?

if (x > y && z > x) {
    cout << "Both conditions = true" << endl;
}

2. What will be printed if x = 1000, y = 15000 and z = 1?

if (x > y || z < y) {
    cout << "At least one of the conditions = true" << endl;
}

3. What will be printed if x = 2, y = 2 and z = 3?

if (!(x < y && z > x)) {
    cout << "Both conditions = false" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "At least one of the conditions = true" << endl;
}
