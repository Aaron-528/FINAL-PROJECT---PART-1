2. If the value assigned to score was 80, what would the output be?

if (score > 90) {
    cout << "Wow! You did excellent!" << endl;
    if (score == 100) {
        cout << "You got a perfect score!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You got a near perfect score." << endl;
    }
} else if (score > 75) {
    cout << "Good job." << endl;
} else {
    cout << "You need improvement." << endl;
}

3. What is the  output of the following code?

int age = 17;
int grade = 12;
if (age < 18) {
    cout << "Minor" << endl;
    if (age >= 13 && grade >= 9) {
        cout << "High school student" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Not a high school student" << endl;
    }
} else {
    cout << "Adult" << endl;
}

Compound Boolean Expression Questions: 

1. What will be printed if x = 4, y = 3 and z = 3?

if (x > y && z > x) {
    cout << "Both conditions = true" << endl;
}

2. What will be printed if x = 1000, y = 15000 and z = 1?

if (x > y || z < y) {
    cout << "At least one of the conditions = true" << endl;
}

3. What will be printed if x = 2, y = 2 and z = 3?

if (!(x < y && z > x)) {
    cout << "Both conditions = false" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "At least one of the conditions = true" << endl;
}

While Loop Questions:

1. What is the output of this code if x = 12?

while (x > 0) {
    x -= 2;
    cout << x << " ";
}

2. True or False: the output of this code is "1 3 9"

int y = 1;
while (y <= 10) {
    cout << y << " ";
    y *= 3;
}
