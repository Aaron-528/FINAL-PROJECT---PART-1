// Aaron Jones - Variable Worksheet

// C++ Def'n: C++ is coding language used to build software for things like video games, OS' and databases.
    
// Beginning to Code

#include <iostream>
// (above) handles input/output
using namespace std;
//  (above) lets us use names for objects and variables from the standard library

int main() {
    // above we use int because the return expects an int value
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    // above cout refers to character output and the "<<" is used to direct what you want to say
    return 0;
    //returning 0 signifies that the program has ended properly
}

// this is the format you use for all of your code in C++, if you want your code to function it must be inside of this int main with return 0

// How to comment on C++
// You use ""//" for single line comments (double forward slashes)
// You use /* */ for multi line comments (forward slash then an asterisk and an asterisk then a forward slash)

// Syntax in C++
// C++ uses curly braces -> {} <- for blocks of code. Python uses indentation
// C++ also needs semicolons -> ; <- to end statements (unlike python)
// Ex:

if (condition) {
    cout << "Condition is true"; // This line is inside the if-statement.
}
cout << "Outside if-statement";

// Variables in main
// In C++, variables are declared with a type and a name (whereas python only uses a value and a name)
// Ex:

int Example; // Here we declare a variable that is an integer (it has a data type (int) and a name (Example))
Example = 10; // Now we assign that variable a value (10)

// Here is an example of how we could use this
int age = 20;
cout << "Age: " << age;

// Another detail for variables
int Age = 21;
cout << "age: " << age << ", Age: " << Age; // These are two different variables because of the difference in capitalization

// Rules for variables in C++
// A variable MUST start with an underscore or a letter
// A variable CANNOT start with a number
// The characters in a variable CAN ONLY be alpha-numeric or an underscore
// They are also case-sensitive

// Aaron Jones - Data Types, Arithmetic, and Operators Worksheet

// C++ Data Types
// In C++ there are 3 data types: numbers, text (characters), and booleans (true/false)
// 1. Numbers: int (integer), float (decimal), double (double-precision decimal)
// 2. Text: char (character)
// 3. Boolean: bool (true or false)

// Ex:
int a = 99999;
char b = 'a';
double c = 3.8;
bool d = false;

// In C++ you can check the type of data by using typeid()
#include <typeinfo>
// the above operator is a typeid operator, this allows us to use typeid() which allows you to get type info at runtime
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 99;
    cout << typeid(x).name();
    return 0;
}

// Now we will cover C++ Text (Characters)
// Characters can be counted as letters, digits, or symbols and must be enclosed in quotes

// Ex:
char greeting = 'H'; // notice how this is a char because it is one letter
string greeting2 = "Hi, my name is Aaron."; // this is a string because it is a sequence of characters

// Numbers in C++
// Numbers in C++ start with a digit (0-9), a dot (for decimal/floating-point numbers), or a minus sign (for negative numbers).
// Integers (int) are whole numbers (no decimal)
// Floating-point numbers/decimals (float/double) have a decimal

// Integers
// A whole number, positive or negative
int b = 991874379235775387;

// Floats and Doubles
// A float or a double is any valid number that has a decimal 
float p = 3.14;  // Float ex
double e = 2.7182818284595342;  // Double ex

// To explain the difference, floats typically have about 7 decimal digits of precision while doubles have about 15.

// Boolean Values
// Reminder: Booleans are NOT strings so no they don't need quotation marks

bool ex1 = 10 > 9;  // returns 1
bool ex2 = 10 == 9; // returns 0
bool ex3 = 10 < 9;  // returns 0

cout << boolalpha; // If you wanted to print out a boolean value rather than 1 or 0, you can use the boolalpha operator
cout << ex1;
cout << ex2;
cout << ex3;

// Casting data types in C++
int i = 7; // Original data type is int
double j = 4.2; // Original data type is double

float w = static_cast<float>(i); // value changed -> is now: 7.0
int q = static_cast<int>(k); // value changed -> is now: 4
string l = to_string(k); // value changed -> is now: '4.2'

cout << w << " " << q << " " << l;
cout << typeid(w).name();
cout << typeid(q).name();
cout << typeid(l).name();

// this would print out the new values of w, q, and l

// Now C++ operators (these are very similar to python)

// Arithmetic Operators

// + Addition (x + y)

// - Subtraction (x - y)

// * Multiplication (x * y)

// / Division (x / y)

// % Modulus (x % y)

// ** For exponents - (C++ does not have a built-in operator (like ** for python) for exponents, so instead use pow(x, y) from the <cmath> library)

// // For floor division - (C++ does not have a built-in operator (like // for python) for floor division, so instead use floor(x / y) from the <cmath> library)

cout << 1 + 3;
cout << 2 * 3;
cout << 6 / 2;

// Assignment Operators

int a = 5;    // Simple Assignment (assigns a value)

a += 3;       // Add and Assign: a = a + 3;  -> a is now 8

a -= 2;       // Subtract and Assign: a = a - 2;  -> a is now 6

a *= 4;       // Multiply and Assign: a = a * 4;  -> a is now 24

a /= 2;       // Divide and Assign: a = a / 2;  -> a is now 12

a %= 5;       // Modulus and Assign: a = a % 5;  -> a is now 2

// Comparison Operators

// == equals (x == y)

// != not equals (x != y)

// > greater than (x > y)

// < less than (x < y)

// >= greater than or equal to (x >= y)

// <= less than or equal to (x <= y)

// All of these above return true or false

cout << (10 != 8);
cout << (12 >= 3);
cout << (5 <= 5);

// Different types of errors

// Syntax errors/compile-time errors

// int areaOfRectangle = 15 x 17; // has a missing operator

// cout << "area is " << areaOfRectangle;

// Logic error/run-time error
int areaOfRectangle = 15 / 17; // here you're using the wrong logic for calculating area therefore error
cout << "area is " << areaOfRectangle;
